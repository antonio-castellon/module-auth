# auth
Authentification Control System for microservices - uses NTLM + LDAP + JWT to maintain the security

    in order to increase the Security (if it's required) we could use the following techniques:
     
       - reduce the expiration time for the tokens
       - create a hash with : <users>:<passwordToken-autogenerated>
     
    * all in order that practically every request contain a new token (but this tech. decrease the performance)
